Ingredients:

1/2 cup of butter (room temperature)
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 large egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.

2. Beat the butter and both sugars in a large mixing bowl until light and
   fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix well.

3. Mix the flour, salt, and baking soda in another bowl. Add the dry
   ingredients to the batter and mix until well blended. Stir in the chocolate
   chips.

4. Drop the dough by small scoops 2 to 3 inches apart on an ungreased cookie
   sheet. Flatten each scoop with the back of a spoon to about 3 inches in
   diameter.

5. Bake until the centers are still slightly soft to the touch, 11 to 14
   minutes. Let cool on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to racks
   to cool completely.
